//HYPOTHESIS

// if Triska came to her friend's house, CONDITIONAL/CAUSE

// then they will teach Java to each other EFFECT

// ELSE she will learn Java by herself at home. EXCEPTION



//5 different example for each data type we learned (byte,
// int
// ,short,
// long,
// double,
// float
// ,boolen and
// char)

//check if 350 is divisible by 2 , 3 , 5  (Check for each number)
//                      if it is divisible print : 350  is divisible by 2 true
//                      if it is not divisible print : 350 is divisible by 2 false

// What is MODULO?

//IT GIVES THE REMAINDER
// 3 % 2 = IT WILL ONLY GIVE THE REMAINDER OF THIS OPERATION.
// 2 ONLY FITS INTO THREE ONCE - 3 DIVIDED BY TWO IT EQUALS 1.5, BUT LET'S JUST THINK ABOUT IT LIKE FRACTIONS
// SO , YOU HAVE 2 FITTING INTO 3 ONE TIME

// AND THEN YOU HAVE 1 REMAINDER == 3/2

// 10 % 5 = 0 MODULO/MODULUS

// 10 / 5 = 2

// IS THERE ANY REMAINDER? WE ARE GOING TO SAY THERE IS 0 REMAINDER
